            The queue canister implementation follows a phased approach, starting with basic scaffolding 
            and progressively adding functionality. Each task builds upon the previous ones to ensure 
            a solid foundation.

            <strong>🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:</strong> Task 5 queue processing logic implementation has been 
            successfully completed with ALL 15 subtasks finished! The queue canister now includes comprehensive 
            processing statistics tracking, automatic periodic processing, batch processing safety, error handling, 
            retry logic, and complete frontend integration.
